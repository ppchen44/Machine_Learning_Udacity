## Project: Predicting Boston Housing Prices

### Getting Started
In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a good fit could then be used to make certain predictions about a home â€” in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.

The dataset for this project originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:

- 16 data points have an 'MEDV' value of 50.0. These data points likely contain missing or censored values and have been removed.
- 1 data point has an 'RM' value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an outlier and has been removed.
- The features 'RM', 'LSTAT', 'PTRATIO', and 'MEDV' are essential. The remaining non-relevant features have been excluded.
- The feature 'MEDV' has been multiplicatively scaled to account for 35 years of market inflation.

Run the code cell below to load the Boston housing dataset, along with a few of the necessary Python libraries required for this project. You will know the dataset loaded successfully if the size of the dataset is reported.

```bash
# Import libraries necessary for this project
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.cross_validation import ShuffleSplit

# Import supplementary visualizations code visuals.py
import visuals as vs

# Pretty display for notebooks
%matplotlib inline

# Load the Boston housing dataset
data = pd.read_csv('housing.csv')
prices = data['MEDV']
features = data.drop('MEDV', axis = 1)
    
# Success
print "Boston housing dataset has {} data points with {} variables each.".format(*data.shape)
```
### Data Exploration
In this first section of this project, you will make a cursory investigation about the Boston housing data and provide your observations. Familiarizing yourself with the data through an explorative process is a fundamental practice to help you better understand and justify your results.

Since the main goal of this project is to construct a working model which has the capability of predicting the value of houses, we will need to separate the dataset into features and the target variable. The features, 'RM', 'LSTAT', and 'PTRATIO', give us quantitative information about each data point. The target variable, 'MEDV', will be the variable we seek to predict. These are stored in features and prices, respectively.

### Implementation: Calculate Statistics
For your very first coding implementation, you will calculate descriptive statistics about the Boston housing prices. Since numpy has already been imported for you, use this library to perform the necessary calculations. These statistics will be extremely important later on to analyze various prediction results from the constructed model.

In the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:

- Calculate the minimum, maximum, mean, median, and standard deviation of 'MEDV', which is stored in prices.
- Store each calculation in their respective variable.

```
# TODO: Minimum price of the data
minimum_price = np.min(prices)

# TODO: Maximum price of the data
maximum_price = np.max(prices)

# TODO: Mean price of the data
mean_price = np.mean(prices)

# TODO: Median price of the data
median_price = np.median(prices)

# TODO: Standard deviation of prices of the data
std_price = np.std(prices)

# Show the calculated statistics
print "Statistics for Boston housing dataset:\n"
print "Minimum price: ${:,.2f}".format(minimum_price)
print "Maximum price: ${:,.2f}".format(maximum_price)
print "Mean price: ${:,.2f}".format(mean_price)
print "Median price ${:,.2f}".format(median_price)
print "Standard deviation of prices: ${:,.2f}".format(std_price)
```
```
Statistics for Boston housing dataset:

Minimum price: $105,000.00
Maximum price: $1,024,800.00
Mean price: $454,342.94
Median price $438,900.00
Standard deviation of prices: $165,171.13
```
### Question 1 - Feature Observation
As a reminder, we are using three features from the Boston housing dataset: 'RM', 'LSTAT', and 'PTRATIO'. For each data point (neighborhood):

- 'RM' is the average number of rooms among homes in the neighborhood.
- 'LSTAT' is the percentage of homeowners in the neighborhood considered "lower class" (working poor).
- 'PTRATIO' is the ratio of students to teachers in primary and secondary schools in the neighborhood.

Using your intuition, for each of the three features above, do you think that an increase in the value of that feature would lead to an increase in the value of 'MEDV' or a decrease in the value of 'MEDV'? Justify your answer for each.

**Hint:** This problem can phrased using examples like below.

- Would you expect a home that has an 'RM' value(number of rooms) of 6 be worth more or less than a home that has an 'RM' value of 7?
- Would you expect a neighborhood that has an 'LSTAT' value(percent of lower class workers) of 15 have home prices be worth more or less than a neighborhood that has an 'LSTAT' value of 20?
- Would you expect a neighborhood that has an 'PTRATIO' value(ratio of students to teachers) of 10 have home prices be worth more or less than a neighborhood that has an 'PTRATIO' value of 15?

**Answer:** In my opinion, the number of 'RM' increases will lead to an increase in the value of 'MEDV'. Larger value of 'RM', larger houses are. An increase in the value of 'LSTAT' will lead to an decrease in the value of 'MEDV'. A large value of 'LSTAT' which indicates that the price of houses is not expensive since many working poor person could afford it.
An increase in the value of 'PTRATIO' will lead to an decrease in the value of 'MEDV'. Larger value of 'PTRATIO' indicates that primary and secondary schools in the neighborhood are not good.
All these guesses could be verified from below graphs.

```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
for col in features.columns:

    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    fit = np.polyfit(features[col], prices, deg=1) # We use a linear fit to compute the trendline
    ax.scatter(features[col],  prices)
    plt.plot(features[col], prices, 'o', color='black')
    ax.plot(features[col], fit[0] * features[col] + fit[1], color='blue', linewidth=3) # This plots a trendline with the regression parameters computed earlier. We should plot this after the dots or it will be covered by the dots themselves
    plt.title('PRICES vs  '+ str(col)) # title here
    plt.xlabel(col) # label here
    plt.ylabel('PRICES') # label here
```
```
# Scattered plot of Prices with 'RM'
for col in features.columns:
    plt.subplots()
    ax.scatter(features[col],  prices)
    plt.plot(features[col], prices, 'o', color='black')
# plt.plot(features['RM'],prices, 'ro')
# plt.ylabel('Prices')
# plt.xlabel('RM')
# plt.title('Scattered plot of Prices with RM')
```
```
# Scattered plot of Prices with 'LSTAT'
plt.plot(features['LSTAT'],prices, 'ro')
plt.ylabel('Prices')
plt.xlabel('LSTAT')
plt.title('Scattered plot of Prices with LSTAT')
```
```
# Scattered plot of Price with 'PTRATIO'
plt.plot(features['PTRATIO'],prices, 'ro')
plt.ylabel('Prices')
plt.xlabel('PTRATIO')
plt.title('Scattered plot of Prices with PTRATIO')
```

### Developing a Model
In this second section of the project, you will develop the tools and techniques necessary for a model to make a prediction. Being able to make accurate evaluations of each model's performance through the use of these tools and techniques helps to greatly reinforce the confidence in your predictions.

#### Implementation: Define a Performance Metric
It is difficult to measure the quality of a given model without quantifying its performance over training and testing. This is typically done using some type of performance metric, whether it is through calculating some type of error, the goodness of fit, or some other useful measurement. For this project, you will be calculating the coefficient of determination, R2, to quantify your model's performance. The coefficient of determination for a model is a useful statistic in regression analysis, as it often describes how "good" that model is at making predictions.

The values for R2 range from 0 to 1, which captures the percentage of squared correlation between the predicted and actual values of the **target variable**. A model with an R2 of 0 is no better than a model that always predicts the mean of the target variable, whereas a model with an R2 of 1 perfectly predicts the target variable. Any value between 0 and 1 indicates what percentage of the target variable, using this model, can be explained by the features. A model can be given a negative R2 as well, which indicates that the model is arbitrarily worse than one that always predicts the mean of the target variable.

For the performance_metric function in the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:

- Use r2_score from sklearn.metrics to perform a performance calculation between y_true and y_predict.
- Assign the performance score to the score variable.

```
# TODO: Import 'r2_score'
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score
def performance_metric(y_true, y_predict):
    """ Calculates and returns the performance score between 
        true and predicted values based on the metric chosen. """
    
    # TODO: Calculate the performance score between 'y_true' and 'y_predict'
    score = r2_score(y_true, y_predict)
    
    # Return the score
    return score
```
## Question 2 - Goodness of Fit
Assume that a dataset contains five data points and a model made the following predictions for the target variable:

```
True Value	Prediction
3.0	2.5
-0.5	0.0
2.0	2.1
7.0	7.8
4.2	5.3
```
```
# Calculate the performance of this model
score = performance_metric([3, -0.5, 2, 7, 4.2], [2.5, 0.0, 2.1, 7.8, 5.3])
print "Model has a coefficient of determination, R^2, of {:.3f}.".format(score)
```
```
Model has a coefficient of determination, R^2, of 0.923.
```
- Would you consider this model to have successfully captured the variation of the target variable?
- Why or why not?
**Hint:** The R2 score is the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable. In other words:

- R2 score of 0 means that the dependent variable cannot be predicted from the independent variable.
- R2 score of 1 means the dependent variable can be predicted from the independent variable.
- R2 score between 0 and 1 indicates the extent to which the dependent variable is predictable. An
- R2 score of 0.40 means that 40 percent of the variance in Y is predictable from X.

**Answer:** Yes, I will consider this model to have successfully captured the variation of the target variable.
Since R2 is 0.923 means that 92.3 percent of the variance in Y is predictable from X.
Run the code cell below to use the performance_metric function and calculate this model's coefficient of determination.

### Implementation: Shuffle and Split Data
Your next implementation requires that you take the Boston housing dataset and split the data into training and testing subsets. Typically, the data is also shuffled into a random order when creating the training and testing subsets to remove any bias in the ordering of the dataset.

For the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:

- Use train_test_split from sklearn.cross_validation to shuffle and split the features and prices data into training and testing sets.
- Split the data into 80% training and 20% testing.
- Set the random_state for train_test_split to a value of your choice. This ensures results are consistent.
- Assign the train and testing splits to X_train, X_test, y_train, and y_test.

```
# TODO: Import 'train_test_split'
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# TODO: Shuffle and split the data into training and testing subsets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, prices, test_size=0.2, random_state = 44, shuffle = True)

# Success
print "Training and testing split was successful."
```
```
Training and testing split was successful.
```
### Question 3 - Training and Testing
- What is the benefit to splitting a dataset into some ratio of training and testing subsets for a learning algorithm?
**Hint:** Think about how overfitting or underfitting is contingent upon how splits on data is done.

**Answer:** The benefit to splitting a dataset into some ratio of training and testing subsets for a learning algorithm is to prevent the learning algorithm from overfitting or underfitting.
Assess the ability of the model to generalize over unseen data by some metrics.

### Analyzing Model Performance
In this third section of the project, you'll take a look at several models' learning and testing performances on various subsets of training data. Additionally, you'll investigate one particular algorithm with an increasing 'max_depth' parameter on the full training set to observe how model complexity affects performance. Graphing your model's performance based on varying criteria can be beneficial in the analysis process, such as visualizing behavior that may not have been apparent from the results alone.

#### Learning Curves
The following code cell produces four graphs for a decision tree model with different maximum depths. Each graph visualizes the learning curves of the model for both training and testing as the size of the training set is increased. Note that the shaded region of a learning curve denotes the uncertainty of that curve (measured as the standard deviation). The model is scored on both the training and testing sets using R2, the coefficient of determination.

Run the code cell below and use these graphs to answer the following question.

```
# Produce learning curves for varying training set sizes and maximum depths
vs.ModelLearning(features, prices)
```
### Question 4 - Learning the Data
Choose one of the graphs above and state the maximum depth for the model.
What happens to the score of the training curve as more training points are added? What about the testing curve?
Would having more training points benefit the model?
Hint: Are the learning curves converging to particular scores? Generally speaking, the more data you have, the better. But if your training and testing curves are converging with a score above your benchmark threshold, would this be necessary? Think about the pros and cons of adding more training points based on if the training and testing curves are converging.

**Answer:**

- I would choose the graph two. The maximum depth of the graph two is 3.
- The score of the traning curve decreases as more traning points are added, but the score of the testing curve increases as more training points are added.
- For graph two with max_depth = 3 for Decision Tress, more traning points are not necessary because the learning curves are converging to 0.8. Adding more training points would not increase the score of the testing curve, moreover, larger dataset would cause more time consumed for model training.

### Complexity Curves
The following code cell produces a graph for a decision tree model that has been trained and validated on the training data using different maximum depths. The graph produces two complexity curves â€” one for training and one for validation. Similar to the **learning curves**, the shaded regions of both the complexity curves denote the uncertainty in those curves, and the model is scored on both the training and validation sets using the performance_metric function.

Run the code cell below and use this graph to answer the following two questions Q5 and Q6.

```
vsvs..ModelComplexityModelCom (X_train, y_train)
```

### Question 5 - Bias-Variance Tradeoff
- When the model is trained with a maximum depth of 1, does the model suffer from high bias or from high variance?
- How about when the model is trained with a maximum depth of 10? What visual cues in the graph justify your conclusions?
Hint: High bias is a sign of underfitting(model is not complex enough to pick up the nuances in the data) and high variance is a sign of overfitting(model is by-hearting the data and cannot generalize well). Think about which model(depth 1 or 10) aligns with which part of the tradeoff.

**Answer:**

- The model suffers from high bias when the model is trained with a maximum depth of 1. Because when the value of maximum depth increases by one, the training score and the validation score increase a lot. This situation indicates the model is too simple or underfitting when the value of maximum depth is 1.
- The model suffers from high variance when the model is trained with a maximum depth of 10. Because when the maximum depth increases to 10, the training score increases, otherwise, the validation score decreases a lot. This is a sign of overfitting.


### Question 6 - Best-Guess Optimal Model
- Which maximum depth do you think results in a model that best generalizes to unseen data?
- What intuition lead you to this answer?
**Hint:** Look at the graph above Question 5 and see where the validation scores lie for the various depths that have been assigned to the model. Does it get better with increased depth? At what point do we get our best validation score without overcomplicating our model? And remember, Occams Razor states "Among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected."

**Answer:**

- I think that maximum depth equals to 4 would result a model that best generalizes to unseen data.
- From the graph above question 5, we get the best validation score without overcomplicating our model when the maximum depth is 4.

### Evaluating Model Performance
In this final section of the project, you will construct a model and make a prediction on the client's feature set using an optimized model from fit_model.

#### Question 7 - Grid Search
- What is the grid search technique?
- How it can be applied to optimize a learning algorithm?
**Hint**: When explaining the Grid Search technique, be sure to touch upon why it is used, what the 'grid' entails and what the end goal of this method is. To solidify your answer, you can also give an example of a parameter in a model that can be optimized using this approach.

**Answer:**

- The grid search technique is a tool to tune parameters when a algorithm has hyper-parameters. And it will give the best parametres combination for a algorithm.
- The grid search makes a table with all the hyper-parameters combinations of a algorithm. Algorithm uses each combination as its parameters to train dataset. The gird search will give the best parameter combination according to a metric such as F1 score.

#### Question 8 - Cross-Validation
- What is the k-fold cross-validation training technique?
- What benefit does this technique provide for grid search when optimizing a model?

**Hint:** When explaining the k-fold cross validation technique, be sure to touch upon what 'k' is, how the dataset is split into different parts for training and testing and the number of times it is run based on the 'k' value.

When thinking about how k-fold cross validation helps grid search, think about the main drawbacks of grid search which are hinged upon using a particular subset of data for training or testing and how k-fold cv could help alleviate that. You can refer to the docs for your answer.

***Answer:**

- In k-fold cross-validation, the original sample is randomly partitioned into k equal sized subsamples. Of the k subsamples, a single subsample is retained as the validation data for testing the model, and the remaining k âˆ’ 1 subsamples are used as training data. Then we just train our model k times. Each time using a different subsmaples as our testing set.
- If grid search only uses a particular subset of data for training or testing, it just likes throwing away some data that could be useful for training our algorithm. k-fold cv could help alleviate this situation by runing the algorithm k times and each time using a different subsamples as testing set and the remaining points as our training set.
- Training the model on k-fold dataset for k times, we calculated average scores of metrics each time. Choose the parameter which concludes to highest scores of metric as our best prarameter for the model.

#### Implementation: Fitting a Model

Your final implementation requires that you bring everything together and train a model using the **decision tree algorithm**. To ensure that you are producing an optimized model, you will train the model using the grid search technique to optimize the 'max_depth' parameter for the decision tree. The 'max_depth' parameter can be thought of as how many questions the decision tree algorithm is allowed to ask about the data before making a prediction. Decision trees are part of a class of algorithms called `supervised learning algorithms`.

In addition, you will find your implementation is using `ShuffleSplit()` for an alternative form of cross-validation (see the 'cv_sets' variable). While it is not the K-Fold cross-validation technique you describe in **Question 8**, this type of cross-validation technique is just as useful!. The `ShuffleSplit()` implementation below will create 10 ('n_splits') shuffled sets, and for each shuffle, 20% ('test_size') of the data will be used as the validation set. While you're working on your implementation, think about the contrasts and similarities it has to the K-fold cross-validation technique.

Please note that ShuffleSplit has different parameters in `scikit-learn` versions 0.17 and 0.18. For the `fit_model function` in the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:

- Use `DecisionTreeRegressor from sklearn.tree` to create a decision tree regressor object.
    - Assign this object to the 'regressor' variable.
- Create a dictionary for `max_depth` with the values from 1 to 10, and assign this to the `params` variable.
- Use `make_scorer from sklearn.metrics` to create a scoring function object.
    - Pass the `performance_metric` function as a parameter to the object.
    - Assign this scoring function to the `scoring_fnc` variable.
- Use `GridSearchCV from sklearn.grid_search` to create a grid search object.
    - Pass the variables `regressor`, `params`, `scoring_fnc`, and `cv_sets` as parameters to the object.
    - Assign the `GridSearchCV` object to the `grid` variable.

```
# TODO: Import 'make_scorer', 'DecisionTreeRegressor', and 'GridSearchCV'
from sklearn.metrics import make_scorer
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor
from sklearn.grid_search import GridSearchCV

def fit_model(X, y):
    """ Performs grid search over the 'max_depth' parameter for a 
        decision tree regressor trained on the input data [X, y]. """
    
    # Create cross-validation sets from the training data

    # sklearn versiin 0.17: ShuffleSplit(n, n_iter=10, test_size=0.1, train_size=None, random_state=None)
    cv_sets = ShuffleSplit(X.shape[0], n_iter = 10, test_size = 0.20, random_state = 0)

    # TODO: Create a decision tree regressor object
    regressor = DecisionTreeRegressor()

    # TODO: Create a dictionary for the parameter 'max_depth' with a range from 1 to 10
    params = {'max_depth':[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]}

    # TODO: Transform 'performance_metric' into a scoring function using 'make_scorer' 
    scoring_fnc = make_scorer(performance_metric)

    # TODO: Create the grid search cv object --> GridSearchCV()
    # Make sure to include the right parameters in the object:
    # (estimator, param_grid, scoring, cv) which have values 'regressor', 'params', 'scoring_fnc', and 'cv_sets' respectively.
    grid = GridSearchCV(regressor, params, cv = cv_sets, scoring = scoring_fnc)

    # Fit the grid search object to the data to compute the optimal model
    grid = grid.fit(X, y)

    # Return the optimal model after fitting the data
    return grid.best_estimator_
```

#### Making Predictions
Once a model has been trained on a given set of data, it can now be used to make predictions on new sets of input data. In the case of a decision tree regressor, the model has learned what the best questions to ask about the input data are, and can respond with a prediction for the **target variable**. You can use these predictions to gain information about data where the value of the target variable is unknown â€” such as data the model was not trained on.

#### Question 9 - Optimal Model
- What maximum depth does the optimal model have? How does this result compare to your guess in **Question 6**?
Run the code block below to fit the decision tree regressor to the training data and produce an optimal model.

```
# Fit the training data to the model using grid search
reg = fit_model(X_train, y_train)

# Produce the value for 'max_depth'
print "Parameter 'max_depth' is {} for the optimal model.".format(reg.get_params()['max_depth'])
```
``Parameter 'max_depth' is 4 for the optimal model.``

**Hint:** The answer comes from the output of the code snipped above.

**Answer:** Maximum depth is 4 for the optimal model. The result just likes what I have gussed in Questin 6.

#### Question 10 - Predicting Selling Prices

Imagine that you were a real estate agent in the Boston area looking to use this model to help price homes owned by your clients that they wish to sell. You have collected the following information from three of your clients:

```
          Feature	                   Client 1	                   Client 2	              Client 3
Total number of rooms in home	         5 rooms	                4 rooms	               8 rooms
Neighborhood poverty level (as %)	      17%	                     32%	                 3%
Student-teacher ratio of nearby schools	 15-to-1	                22-to-1	               12-to-1
```
