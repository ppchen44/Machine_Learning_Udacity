## Project: Write an Algorithm for a Dog Identification App

### Why We're Here
In this notebook, you will make the first steps towards developing an algorithm that could be used as part of a mobile or web app. At the end of this project, your code will accept any user-supplied image as input. If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog's breed. If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling. The image below displays potential sample output of your finished project (... but we expect that each student's algorithm will behave differently!).

In this real-world setting, you will need to piece together a series of models to perform different tasks; for instance, the algorithm that detects humans in an image will be different from the CNN that infers dog breed. There are many points of possible failure, and no perfect algorithm exists. Your imperfect solution will nonetheless create a fun user experience!

### Step 0: Import Datasets
#### Import Dog Dataset
In the code cell below, we import a dataset of dog images. We populate a few variables through the use of the load_files function from the scikit-learn library:

- train_files, valid_files, test_files - numpy arrays containing file paths to images
- train_targets, valid_targets, test_targets - numpy arrays containing onehot-encoded classification labels
- dog_names - list of string-valued dog breed names for translating labels

```
from sklearn.datasets import load_files       
from keras.utils import np_utils
import numpy as np
from glob import glob

# define function to load train, test, and validation datasets
def load_dataset(path):
    data = load_files(path)
    dog_files = np.array(data['filenames'])
    dog_targets = np_utils.to_categorical(np.array(data['target']), 133)
    return dog_files, dog_targets

# load train, test, and validation datasets
train_files, train_targets = load_dataset('dogImages/train')
valid_files, valid_targets = load_dataset('dogImages/valid')
test_files, test_targets = load_dataset('dogImages/test')

# load list of dog names
dog_names = [item[20:-1] for item in sorted(glob("dogImages/train/*/"))]

# print statistics about the dataset
print('There are %d total dog categories.' % len(dog_names))
print('There are %s total dog images.\n' % len(np.hstack([train_files, valid_files, test_files])))
print('There are %d training dog images.' % len(train_files))
print('There are %d validation dog images.' % len(valid_files))
print('There are %d test dog images.'% len(test_files))
```
```
There are 133 total dog categories.
There are 8351 total dog images.

There are 6680 training dog images.
There are 835 validation dog images.
There are 836 test dog images.

  ```
#### Import Human Dataset
In the code cell below, we import a dataset of human images, where the file paths are stored in the numpy array human_files.

```

importimport  randomrandom
 randomrandom..seedseed((86753098675309)

# load filenames in shuffled human dataset
human_files = np.array(glob("lfw/*/*"))
random.shuffle(human_files)

# print statistics about the dataset
print('There are %d total human images.' % len(human_files))
```
```
There are 13233 total human images.
```
#### Step 1: Detect Humans
We use OpenCV's implementation of Haar feature-based cascade classifiers to detect human faces in images. OpenCV provides many pre-trained face detectors, stored as XML files on github. We have downloaded one of these detectors and stored it in the haarcascades directory.

In the next code cell, we demonstrate how to use this detector to find human faces in a sample image.

```
import cv2                
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt                        
%matplotlib inline                               

# extract pre-trained face detector
face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier('haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml')

# load color (BGR) image
img = cv2.imread(human_files[3])
# convert BGR image to grayscale
gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# find faces in image
faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray)

# print number of faces detected in the image
print('Number of faces detected:', len(faces))

# get bounding box for each detected face
for (x,y,w,h) in faces:
    # add bounding box to color image
    cv2.rectangle(img,(x,y),(x+w,y+h),(255,0,0),2)
    
# convert BGR image to RGB for plotting
cv_rgb = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)

# display the image, along with bounding box
plt.imshow(cv_rgb)
plt.show()
```
Before using any of the face detectors, it is standard procedure to convert the images to grayscale. The detectMultiScale function executes the classifier stored in face_cascade and takes the grayscale image as a parameter.

In the above code, faces is a numpy array of detected faces, where each row corresponds to a detected face. Each detected face is a 1D array with four entries that specifies the bounding box of the detected face. The first two entries in the array (extracted in the above code as x and y) specify the horizontal and vertical positions of the top left corner of the bounding box. The last two entries in the array (extracted here as w and h) specify the width and height of the box.

##### Write a Human Face Detector
We can use this procedure to write a function that returns True if a human face is detected in an image and False otherwise. This function, aptly named face_detector, takes a string-valued file path to an image as input and appears in the code block below.
